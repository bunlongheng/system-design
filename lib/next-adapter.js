// to get right, and every existing handler test still exercises shipping code.
// isLocal() checks the PEER SOCKET ADDRESS on purpose - a Host header is
// spoofable, a TCP source address is not. Next route handlers do not expose the
// socket, so it is reconstructed here.

// reads this (unless LOCAL_DEV is explicitly set), so a forged header cannot
// open anything - and leaving it blank there keeps that guarantee obvious.
